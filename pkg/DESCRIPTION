Description: Variable elimination (Gaussian elimination, Fourier-Motzkin elimination), 
    Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, reduction to reduced row echelon form, value substitution,  
    projecting a vector on the convex polytope described by a system of (in)equations, 
    simplify systems by removing spurious columns and rows and collapse implied equalities, 
    test if a matrix is totally unimodular, compute variable ranges implied by linear
    (in)equalities.
