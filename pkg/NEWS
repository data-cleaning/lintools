version 0.1.5
 - Fix in 'compact': pairs of inequations were not detected correctly.

version 0.1.3
 - Updated uses of .Call to include PACKAGE="lintools" (thanks to Harm Jan Boonstra)
 - Switched to the 'tinytest' testing framework

version 0.1.2
 - 'compact' now removes duplicate rows from linear systems (controlled by 
   new argument 'deduplicate').
 - bugfix: in some cases, 'compact' would return the wrong value for 'neq'.
 - bugfix in 'compact': cases of differing b_i and b_j, Ai. + Aj. = 0, and both
   of type '<=' would incorrectly be combined to an equality.

version 0.1.1.4
 - bugfix in 'eliminate': faulty update of H matrix led to crashes in some cases.
 - bugfix in 'compact': ins some cases the wrong neq was returned.

version 0.1.1.3
 - bugfix in ranges. Crashed on some cases where matrices w/zero rows were created.
 - native routines now registered as requested by CRAN

version 0.1.1.1
 - new function 'is_totally_unimodular'
 - new function 'ranges' computes variable ranges implied by a system of (in)equations
 - eliminate gains argument 'eps' to control numerical accuracy
 - deprecated sparseConstraints in favor of the more consistent name sparse_constraints
 - bugfix: pinv crashed on matrices with a single s.v. 
 - bugfix: eliminate would sometimes report the wrong number of (in)equalities
 - bugfix: eliminate sometimes crashed because of a mismatch in colnames of history matrix

version 0.1.0
 - Initial release
